# LiSFinalProject
For my website, I chose to redesign Best Electronics, which is a business that focuses on selling various Atari and gaming products. Because the store focuses on gaming and electronics, I decided to take design inspiration from companies like Epic Games and Game Stop when designing the site. While Best Electronics specializes in technology from the ’80s, their website design is outdated and most likely hasn’t been updated ever. 
My website aims at making an updated modern design of Best Electronics’, allowing for a more user-friendly and clean layout to appeal to customers. Like I mentioned before, I took inspiration from several gaming companies, as I felt it would establish a sense of familiarity when viewing the website, while also having a unique design. I went with open-sans, sans-serif for the font, as I wanted to keep it simple and readable. In addition, I kept the color palette fairly simple with black and white background. I also chose blue and red as accent colors, as they are the two colors that come to mind when I think of gaming. The overall goal was to make a more modern design for Best Electronics website while still keeping hints of the retro nature of Atari.
